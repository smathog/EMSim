# Description

This is my implemenetation of an election methods simulator, written in Rust. My goal is to create an application which can replicate the capabilities of previous election method simulators, and hopefully extend upon them in certain areas (namely the simulation of strategic behavior).

For now, this is just a preliminary README.
